# PhotometryAnalyzer
Photometry Analyzer is a software package designed to synchronize data from behavioural data sources to fiber photometry data. Photometry Analyzer is legacy software that is being replaced by the MousePAD project. 

Photometry Analyzer currently supports the following file formats:
ABET II Raw Behavioural Data
Anymaze Raw Behavioural Data
Doric Lenses Fiber Photometry Data

The program includes a simplified GUI interface for selecting behaviours and data sources of interest. Fields are populated once the files of interest are selected. Users can choose to output the data to a variety of formats.
